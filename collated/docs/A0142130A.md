### History Component

<p align="center">
<img src="images/HistoryClassDiagram.png" width="500"><br>

<em>Diagram 11: History Class Diagram </em>
</p>

The diagram above gives an overview of how the `History` component is implemented.<br>
<br>**API** : [`History.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskell/model/History.java)

The `History` component,
* stores the commands that UndoCommand can execute (add/delete/done/undone/edit)
* exposes list of command input strings for UI display
* updates list of command history every time a command is executed

```
###### \DeveloperGuide.md
``` md

#### Use case: Undo command

**MSS**

1. User enters a command
2. Taskell executes it
3. User requests to view undo commands history
4. User requests to undo command at specific index
5. Taskell reverts the command <br>
Use case ends

**Extensions**

3a. The user did not enter any previous command

> 3a1. Taskell shows a message indicating no commands available for undo<br>

4a. The user enters invalid index

> 4a1. Taskell shows error message indicating index is invalid<br>

```

#### Use case: View calendar for the week

**MSS**

1. User requests to view calendar
2. Taskell displays calendar
  
#### Use case: Save data to specified folder

**MSS**

1. User requests to save all tasks
2. Taskell saves all tasks in the requested folder <br>
Use case ends

**Extensions**

1a. User gives invalid filename (contains illegal symbols not allowed in file names)

> 1a1. Taskell shows an error message and still saves data in previous old location.<br>

2a. Data cannot be written to the requested folder (invalid directory or access prohibited)

> 2a1. Taskell shows an error message and still saves data in previous old location.<br>

#### Use case: Clear task

**MSS**

1. User requests to clear all tasks
2. Taskell shows pop-up to ask for confirmation
3. User confirms
4. Taskell deletes all tasks
Use case ends

**Extensions**

3a. User cancels request

> 3a1. Taskell does not clear all tasks <br>

#### Remember the Milk
**Pros:**<br>
1. Can be used offline and tasks are synced once internet connection is established<br>
2. Can handle some natural languages processing by saving deadlines from task information itself (e.g. Do math homework tomorrow: Saves task with deadline set to tomorrow)<br>
3. Can undo when marking tasks as done (recover from accidentally marking a task as done)<br>
4. Can set priority, and list tasks by priority<br>
5. Can set recursive tasks<br>

**Cons:**<br>
1. Need to click frequently to enter or edit a task<br>
2. Need to remember lots of shortcuts, so user is less likely to use them<br>
3. Has a cluttered interface, which is not intuitive<br>
4. Does not support calendar view in-house<br>

#### Finding tasks: `find`
You can use the find command to view tasks with specific keywords. Tasks with words that match the keyword include those that contain the keyword, for example, searching for "book" will match with "book", "textbook", "storybook" etc. You can also search with multiple keywords at the same time.<br>
Formats: <br>
- `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`<br>
Displays a list of tasks with description or tags that match all the keywords.<br>
Example: `find banana milk essay`<br>
This returns all tasks with description or tags that match all keywords `banana`, `milk`, and `essay`. <br>

- `find-tag TAG [MORE_TAGS]`<br>
Displays list of tasks with the same tags. Use this if you want to only search by tags and not description.<br>
Example: `find homework essay cs2103`<br>
This returns any task with either tag `homework`, `essay`, or `cs2103`.<br>
 <br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/find_cs2010.PNG" width="800"></br>
 <br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/find_cs2010_results.PNG" width="800"></br> <br>
Diagrams 3 and 4: Keying in `find cs2010` displays list of tasks with "cs2010" as one of the keywords in task description

> Take Note! <br>
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `chicken egg` will match `egg chicken`.
> * Full words will be matched e.g. `chicken` will match `chickens`.
> * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
    e.g. `chicken` will match `chicken duck`

#### Showing history : `history` or `hist`
You can view the command history available for undo on the right panel to refer to when undoing previous commands.<br>
To save your time, Taskell has a short form command `hist`. <br>
Format: `history` <br>

<br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/history_01.PNG" width="800"></br>
 <br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/history_02.PNG" width="800"></br> <br>
 Diagrams 5 and 6: `hist` will show list of command history on the right panel

> Take Note! <br>
> * Only commands available for undo are shown here. 
> * Refer to undo section for more information about what commands undo supports.

#### Reverting previous action : `undo`
If you wish to undo your most recent action, you can do so by using the undo command.<br>
You can also undo previous commands, <kbd>Enter</kbd> `hist` to see a list of 
previous commands that can be undone.<br>
Then use undo command with specified INDEX from the list of command history.<br>
Formats: <br>
-`undo`<br> 
Undo most recent command executed.<br>
-`undo INDEX`<br> 
Undo by index of command history.<br>
Example: `hist`, then `undo 3`, will undo third command in command history.<br>

 <br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/undo_02.PNG" width="800"></br> <br>
Diagrams 7 and 8: `undo 2` will undo 2nd command in history

> Take Note! <br>
> * Undo command only supports add, edit, delete, done, undone and undo commands.
> * Clear commands are irreversible!

#### Showing calendar view : `calendar` or `cal`
You can view the calendar for the week on the right panel to refer to the dates and any events scheduled 
when adding tasks and scheduling events. There is also a single red line displayed to show you the current time for your ease in checking your schedule.<br>
<br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/calendar_circle.png" width="800"></br>
Diagram 12: An example of how the current time marker looks like.<br>

Calendar view depends on the list of tasks on the left panel, with each section marked with the index corresponding to the task, meaning a block marked "4" would correspond with the 4th task.<br>
By default, the calendar view will be shown on the right panel. As `history` displays command history on the right panel as well, this command is meant for your convenience if you want to view calendar again.<br>
Please note that entering other commands (i.e. `find`, `add`) will also revert the right panel back to calendar as it is the default view. <br>
To save your time, Taskell has a short form command `cal`. <br>
Format: `calendar`<br>

#### Saving the information in Taskell : `save`
You can specify the path of a folder to store Taskell's data file. Please note that you should have permissions to access the folder. <br>
To obtain the filepath, navigate to the required file in your File Explorer. Copy the path at the top of the
screen and paste into Taskell. Refer to diagram 12 for an example of a filepath. <br>

<p align="center"> <img src="images/filepath_screenshot.png" width="1000"> </br>
Diagram 13: Screenshot of File Explorer in Windows.  <br>

If the specified directory is valid but the file is missing, for example if command is `save C:\Users\Jim\Documents\chicken`,  and `C:\Users\Jim\Documents\chicken` is valid
but `chicken` file is not created, Taskell will create the file for you.<br>
Format: `save FOLDERPATH`<br>
Example: `save C:\Users\Jim\Documents`

> Take Note! <br>
> * If you only specify a folder name without directory, i.e. `save cat`, Taskell will create a file
named "cat" within Taskell's own directory. Whereas `save C:/Users/Jim/Documents/cat` will open a file named "cat" within your desktop's Documents folder.
> * Both Windows and Linux OS have restricted symbols not allowed for filenames. Please be aware of the symbols
shown in the table below.
    
Windows |  Linux 
-------- | :-------- 
    `>` | `<`
    `<` | `>`
    `:` | `:`
    `"` | `&`
    `/` | `/`
    `\` | `|`
    `|` | 
    `?` |
    `*` |

#### Clearing all entries : `clear`
Permanently clears **all** task data. <br>
Format: `clear`  

 <br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/clear.PNG" width="800"></br><br>
Diagrams 14: Typing `clear` will prompt a confirm pop-up window <br>

> Take Note! <br>
> * Clear commands are irreversible!

**Q**: Do I have to save the data every time I enter new tasks? <br>
**A**: No, Taskell auto-saves your data every time you enter new tasks. Use `save` only when you want to
transfer your data to a new location on your computer. <br>

**Q**: Do I have to use `exit` command when I want to exit the application? <br>
**A**: There is no need to, as Taskell can be closed by the top right X button with the mouse as well. This command is for your convenience if you prefer to use the keyboard. <br>
