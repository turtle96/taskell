## Introduction
Are you having a hard time remembering all the work you have to do? Do you have trouble finding a task manager that suits your preference for keyboard input? Well, worry no more, Taskell is here for you! <br>
Taskell will be your personal secretary. It will keep track of your daily tasks and remind you of any important dates and deadlines. What distinguishes Taskell from other task managers is that Taskell only requires a single line of command for every task input. This means that you can record each one of your tasks with just a single statement. You will no longer have to use a mouse if you do not wish to. <br>
Ready to begin life anew with a more efficient task manager? Read on to find out more!

#### Adding a task: **`add`**
To add a floating task<br>
Format: 
`add` TASK <br>
Example: `add` Read Harry Potter book <br>

To add a task with priority<br>
Format:
`add` TASK <i>p/</i>PRIORITY <br>
Example: `add` Complete math assignment <i>p/</i>3<br>

To add a task with tag(s)<br>
Formats:
- `add` TASK <i>#</i>TAG <br>
Example: `add` Meet Alice in Bugis <i>#</i>friends<br>
- `add` TASK <i>#</i>TAG [<i>#</i>MORE_TAGS] <br>
Example: `add` Swimming with Jane <i>#</i>friends <i>#</i>leisure <br>

To add a recurring task <br>
Format:
`add` TASK <i>r/</i>RECURRING <br>
Example: `add` Read newspaper <i>on</i> mon <i>r/</i>daily
> Floating tasks are not allowed to have recurring status since there are no element of date or time

To add a task with date and time<br>
Formats:
- `add` TASK <i>from</i> START_DATE <i>to</i> END_DATE<br>
Example: `add` Go camping at Kota Tinggi <i>from</i> 3-jun-2016 <i>to</i> 7-jun-2016
- `add` TASK <i>from</i> START_TIME <i>to</i> END_TIME <br>
Example: `add` Watch Dr Strange <i>from</i> 7.30pm <i>to</i> 9.25pm


To allow greater flexibility in the command format, Taskell supports a few natural variation such as <i>by</i>, <i>on</i> and <i>at</i>.
<br>

The <i>by</i> keyword indicates that the task is a deadline task. Any date or time preceded by this keyword will be stored as an end date and end time respectively.
<br>
Formats:
- `add` TASK <i>by</i> DATE <br>
Example: `add` Buy textbook <i>by</i> tuesday
- `add` TASK <i>by</i> TIME<br>
Example: `add` visit Sandy at her house by the seaside <i>by</i> 3.35pm
- `add` TASK <i>by</i>  DATE <i>by</i>  TIME <br>
Example: `add` Do lab homework <i>by</i> Friday <i>by</i> 7pm
<br>

The <i>on</i> keyword indicates that the task has to be done on the given date. Any date preceded by this keyword will be stored as a start date.
<br>


Format:
`add` TASK <i>on</i> DATE<br>
Example: `add` Go for meeting <i>on</i> mon <br>


The <i>at</i> keyword indicates that the task has to be done at the given time. Any time preceded by this keyword will be stored as a start time.
<br>

Format:
`add` TASK <i>at</i> TIME <br>
Example: `add` Go for meeting <i>at</i> 3pm <br>


Having understood the aforementioned behaviours of the <i>by</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>at</i>, <i>from</i> and <i>to</i> keyword, you can fuse them together to form more complex tasks.
<br>
Formats:
- `add` TASK <i>on</i> DATE <i>at</i> TIME <br>
Example: `add` Go for meeting <i>on</i> Sunday <i>at</i> 3pm <br>
- `add` TASK <i>on</i> DATE <i>by</i> TIME <br>
Example: `add` Go for meeting <i>by</i> 3pm <i>on</i> 1-jan
- `add` TASK <i>from</i> DATE <br>
Example:`add` Go out with friends <i>from</i> 9am
- `add` TASK <i>on</i> DATE <i>from</i> TIME <i>to</i> TIME <br>
Example: `add` Watch webcast <i>on</i> sat <i>from</i> 4.45pm <i>to</i> 7pm
- `add` TASK <i>from</i> DATE <i>to</i> DATE <i>from</i> TIME <i>to</i> TIME [<i>#</i>TAG] [<i>p/</i>PRIORITY]  [<i>r/</i>RECURRING] <br>
Example: `add` Holiday in San Francisco at Ocean Beach by the sea <i>from</i> may <i>to</i> aug <i>from</i> 9am <i>to</i> 11pm <i>#</i>holiday <i>#</i>leisure <i>p/</i>3 <i>r/</i>monthly

Moreover, Taskell is able to make automatic adjustments to the date and time so that the task entered remains relevant <br> 
Examples: 
- `add` Create powerpoint slides for project <i>from</i> 11pm <i>to</i> 3am <br>
This task will be added as a valid task that starts today at 11pm and ends  tomorrow at 3pm
- `add` Staycation with friends <i>from</i> sunday <i>to</i> tues <br>
If today is a Saturday, this task will be added as a valid task that starts from tomorrow and end on this coming Tuesday <br>
If today is a Sunday, this task will be added as a valid task that starts from next Sunday and end on the following Tuesday

#### Finding tasks: `find`
You can use the find command to view tasks with specific keywords. Tasks with words that match the keyword include those that contain the keyword, for example, searching for "book" will match with "book", "textbook", "storybook" etc. You can also search with multiple keywords at the same time.<br>
Formats: <br>
- `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`<br>
Displays a list of tasks with description or tags that match all the keywords.<br>
Example: `find banana milk essay`<br>
This returns all tasks with description or tags that match all keywords `banana`, `milk`, and `essay`. <br>

- `find-tag TAG [MORE_TAGS]`<br>
Displays list of tasks with the same tags. Use this if you want to only search by tags and not description.<br>
Example: `find homework essay cs2103`<br>
This returns any task with either tag `homework`, `essay`, or `cs2103`.<br>
 <br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/find_cs2010.PNG" width="800"></br>
 <br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/find_cs2010_results.PNG" width="800"></br> <br>
Diagrams 3 and 4: Keying in `find cs2010` displays list of tasks with "cs2010" as one of the keywords in task description

> Take Note! <br>
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `chicken egg` will match `egg chicken`.
> * Full words will be matched e.g. `chicken` will match `chickens`.
> * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
    e.g. `chicken` will match `chicken duck`

> Take Note! <br>
> * Only commands available for undo are shown here. 
> * Refer to undo section for more information about what commands undo supports.

#### Reverting previous action : `undo`
If you wish to undo your most recent action, you can do so by using the undo command.<br>
You can also undo previous commands, <kbd>Enter</kbd> `hist` to see a list of 
previous commands that can be undone.<br>
Then use undo command with specified INDEX from the list of command history.<br>
Formats: <br>
-`undo`<br> 
Undo most recent command executed.<br>
-`undo INDEX`<br> 
Undo by index of command history.<br>
Example: `hist`, then `undo 3`, will undo third command in command history.<br>

#### Showing calendar view : `calendar` or `cal`
You can view the calendar for the week on the right panel to refer to the dates and any events scheduled 
when adding tasks and scheduling events. There is also a single red line displayed to show you the current time for your ease in checking your schedule.<br>
<br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/calendar_circle.PNG" width="800"></br>
Diagram 12: An example of how the current time marker looks like.<br>

Calendar view depends on the list of tasks on the left panel, with each section marked with the index corresponding to the task, meaning a block marked "4" would correspond with the 4th task.<br>
By default, the calendar view will be shown on the right panel. As `history` displays command history on the right panel as well, this command is meant for your convenience if you want to view calendar again.<br>
Please note that entering other commands (i.e. `find`, `add`) will also revert the right panel back to calendar as it is the default view. <br>
To save your time, Taskell has a short form command `cal`. <br>
Format: `calendar`<br>

#### Saving the information in Taskell : `save`
You can specify the path of a folder to store Taskell's data file. Please note that you should have permissions to access the folder. <br>
To obtain the filepath, navigate to the required file in your File Explorer. Copy the path at the top of the
screen and paste into Taskell. Refer to diagram 12 for an example of a filepath. <br>

<p align="center"> <img src="images/filepath_screenshot.png" width="1000"> </br>
Diagram 13: Screenshot of File Explorer in Windows.  <br>

If the specified directory is valid but the file is missing, for example if command is `save C:\Users\Jim\Documents\chicken`,  and `C:\Users\Jim\Documents\chicken` is valid
but `chicken` file is not created, Taskell will create the file for you.<br>
Format: `save FOLDERPATH`<br>
Example: `save C:\Users\Jim\Documents`

> Take Note! <br>
> * If you only specify a folder name without directory, i.e. `save cat`, Taskell will create a file
named "cat" within Taskell's own directory. Whereas `save C:/Users/Jim/Documents/cat` will open a file named "cat" within your desktop's Documents folder.
