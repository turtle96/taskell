## Introduction
Are you having a hard time remembering all the work you have to do? Do you have trouble finding a task manager that suits your preference for keyboard input? Well, worry no more, Taskell is here for you! <br>
Taskell will be your personal secretary. It will keep track of your daily tasks and remind you of any important dates and deadlines. What distinguishes Taskell from other task managers is that Taskell only requires a single line of command for every task input. This means that you can record each one of your tasks with just a single statement. You will no longer have to use a mouse if you do not wish to. <br>
Ready to begin life anew with a more efficient task manager? Read on to find out more!

#### Finding tasks: `find`
You can use the find command to view tasks with specific keywords. Tasks with words that match the keyword include those that contain the keyword, for example, searching for "book" will match with "book", "textbook", "storybook" etc. You can also search with multiple keywords at the same time.<br>

This returns all tasks with description or tags that match all keywords `banana`, `milk`, and `essay`. <br>

-`find-tag TAG [MORE_TAGS]`<br>
Displays list of tasks with the same tags. Use this if you want to only search by tags and not description.<br>
Example: `find homework essay cs2103`<br>
This returns any task with either tag `homework`, `essay`, or `cs2103`.<br>
 <br><p align="center"><img src="images/screenshots/find_cs2010.PNG" width="800"></br>

#### Showing calendar view : `calendar` or `cal`
You can view the calendar for the week on the right panel to refer to the dates and any events scheduled 
when adding tasks and scheduling events.<br>
By default, the calendar view will be shown on the right panel. As `history` displays command history on the right panel as well, this command is meant for your convenience if you want to view calendar again.<br>
Please note that entering other commands (i.e. `find`, `add`) will also revert the right panel back to calendar as it is the default view. <br>
To save your time, Taskell has a short form command `cal`. <br>
Format: `calendar`<br>

#### Saving the information in Taskell : `save`
You can specify the path of a folder to store Taskell's data file. Please note that you should have permissions to access the folder. <br>
To obtain the filepath, navigate to the required file in your File Explorer. Copy the path at the top of the
screen and paste into Taskell. Refer to diagram 12 for an example of a filepath. <br>

<p align="center"> <img src="images/filepath_screenshot.png" width="1000"> </br>
Diagram 12: Screenshot of File Explorer in Windows.  <br>

If the specified directory is valid but the file is missing, for example if command is `save C:\Users\Jim\Documents\chicken`,  and `C:\Users\Jim\Documents\chicken` is valid
but `chicken` file is not created, Taskell will create the file for you.<br>
Format: `save FOLDERPATH`<br>
Example: `save C:\Users\Jim\Documents`

> Take Note! <br>
> * If you only specify a folder name without directory, i.e. `save cat`, Taskell will create a file
named "cat" within Taskell's own directory. Whereas `save C:/Users/Jim/Documents/cat` will open a file named "cat" within your desktop's Documents folder.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the application in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Taskell folder.<br>

<!--- @@author A0142130A --->

**Q**: Do I have to save the data every time I enter new tasks? <br>
**A**: No, Taskell auto-saves your data every time you enter new tasks. Use `save` only when you want to
transfer your data to a new location on your computer. <br>

**Q**: Do I have to use `exit` command when I want to exit the application? <br>
**A**: There is no need to, as Taskell can be closed by the top right X button with the mouse as well. This command is for your convenience if you prefer to use the keyboard. <br>
